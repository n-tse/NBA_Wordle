Name of Student: Nick Tse

Name of Project: NBA Wordle

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) 
* The app will be a web-based guessing game where the user will try to guess the name of a random, current NBA player using clues like current team, height, age, and position.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* the user should be able to guess the name of a NBA player and the app should display which attributes of the player guessed match the attributes of the mystery player
* after 8 guesses, if the user still has not guessed the correct player, then the app should show the user who the mystery player is
* categories: team, division, conference, height, weight, age, position, number
* categories that are correct should highlight in green; close should highlight in yellow; completely off will not highlight

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* NBA API https://github.com/swar/nba_api
* React

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Different game modes(easy, hard, an option for clues/hints)
* light and dark theme
* share results with friends

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* TBD

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
* still in the very early research phase! Will continue to add more as I learn more
